### Explain the purpose of a version control system (VCS) in software development.
A version control system (VCS) is essential in software development as it tracks and manages changes to code and files over time. It enables multiple developers to collaborate on the same project by keeping a history of every change made, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if necessary. VCS helps prevent conflicts when merging changes from different contributors, ensures code integrity, and supports branching and merging strategies for efficient project management. It also provides a backup mechanism in case of accidental data loss.

### What are branches in Git, and why are they useful?
Branches in Git are parallel versions of the repository that allow developers to work on different features or bug fixes independently from the main codebase (often the main or master branch). They are useful because they enable isolated development, where changes can be made and tested without affecting the stable code. Once the work on a branch is complete, it can be merged back into the main branch. This workflow allows for safer and more organised development, facilitating collaboration and continuous integration.
