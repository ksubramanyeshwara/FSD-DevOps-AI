### What is the purpose of the .gitignore file, and how does it improve project management in Git?
The .gitignore file is used to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git and not tracked in a repository. This improves project management by preventing unnecessary files—such as temporary files, log files, compiled binaries, and personal configuration files—from cluttering the repository. By excluding these files, the .gitignore file ensures that only relevant source code and resources are versioned, making the repository cleaner and easier to manage.
