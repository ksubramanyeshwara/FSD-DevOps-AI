### Explain the difference between Git and GitHub.
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files. It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without conflicting with each other's work. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a web interface, collaboration tools like pull requests, code reviews, issue tracking, and continuous integration services.

### What is the difference between git pull and git fetch?
git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and immediately tries to merge them into your current branch. git fetch: Fetches changes from the remote repository but does not merge them. It updates your local copy of the remote branch.

### Explain how Git tracks changes in files.
Git tracks changes by creating snapshots of your files in each commit. It stores the differences (deltas) between the current and previous versions to efficiently manage data.

### Explain the purpose of branches in Git.
Branches in Git allow you to work on different features or fixes independently. Each branch represents a separate line of development.

### What is the Significance of the HEAD pointer in Git?
